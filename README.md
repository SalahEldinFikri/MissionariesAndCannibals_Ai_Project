# MissionariesAndCannibals_Ai_Project
Missionaries and Cannibals is a classic puzzle game that involves three missionaries and three cannibals who are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can carry up to two people at a time. The objective of the game is to transport all the people from one side of the river to the other side, without ever allowing the number of cannibals on either side of the river to exceed the number of missionaries.

The game starts with all six people and the boat on one side of the river. The player must then make a sequence of moves, each move consisting of the player choosing two people to cross the river in the boat. If at any time the number of cannibals on either side of the river is greater than the number of missionaries, the game is lost. The game is won when all six people are on the other side of the river, with no more than three people in the boat at any given time.

The game is often used as a problem-solving exercise, as it requires the player to think critically and make strategic decisions in order to achieve the goal. The game can be played with different variations, such as having more or fewer people, a larger or smaller boat, or different constraints on the movements of the boat.
